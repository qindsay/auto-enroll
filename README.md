# auto-enroll
UCLA enrollment tracker. Program that parses through UCLA class websites, determines status of the class (Open, Waitlist, or Closed), and notifies me when a class is available to enroll in.

Use command line to add urls to track, and email I'm sending from/receiving from is located in .env file.
